# Day 5 – Password Generator 🔐

Part of my **100 Days of Python Projects** challenge.  
This project recreates the classic Python Password Generator using a terminal-style web interface.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
The Password Generator allows the user to create secure passwords based on their preferences.  
It can generate two types of passwords:
- A **strong password** with a completely random mix of characters
- A **sequence password** where letters, numbers, and symbols appear in a fixed order

---

## 📚 What I Learned
- Using loops to repeat actions efficiently
- Generating sequences using numeric ranges
- Applying randomization to improve security
- Translating Python looping logic into JavaScript
- Structuring code for clarity and reuse

---

## 🛠 How It Works
1. User specifies how many letters, numbers, and symbols they want  
2. The app generates:
   - A **strong password** with randomized characters  
   - A **sequence password** with characters in a fixed order  
3. The generated password(s) are displayed in the terminal  

---

## 💡 Code Highlights
- Randomly selecting characters from predefined sets
- Using loops to build passwords dynamically
- Shuffling character order for stronger password generation
- Clear separation between random and sequential logic

---

## 🧪 Example
      Welcome to the Password Generator!
      How many letters would you like in your password? 6
      How many symbols would you like? 2
      How many numbers would you like? 3

      Strong password: aB#9@k2
      Sequence password: abcd12@#

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open the project using the **Live Demo link**, or  
2. Clone the repository and open `index.html` in a browser  
3. Click **Run** and follow the on-screen prompts
